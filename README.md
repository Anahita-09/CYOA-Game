# 🌦️ CYOA-Game: Mumbai Weather Adventure

Welcome to the **Choose Your Own Adventure** game set in the unpredictable weather of Mumbai!
This is a interactive game that I made which allows users to make choices by pressing on-screen buttons and navigating through various weather scenarios in search of shelter.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Start the game by clicking the "Enter" button.
2. You’ll come across two options to save yourself from sudden weather changes (sun, rain).
3. You should then maken a decisions by clicking on one of the buttons.
4. Each choice leads you down a different path. Some choices will lead you to shelter (a shed), others will not.
5. Find the right path to successfully escape the bad weather!

## 🛠️ Features

There are multiple screens to make decisions. Custom weather animations for sunny and rain. Interactive button and I have included a personalized font as well for a better look. And the background also changes based on the users choices.

## Iteration Ideas For Future

If I werw to enhance this game in future I would make more branches(paths) so they the user can have a deeper journer. Include sound effects for when the user clicks a button. And also create better animations for the weather changing.
